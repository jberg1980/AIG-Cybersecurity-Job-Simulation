## Program Breakdown:

### Task 1. Response to Zero Day Vulnerability:
I was tasked with addressing a zero-day vulnerability impacting the Product Development Staging Environment’s infrastructure. This involved:

- Staying Informed: I began by reviewing the latest publications from the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) to grasp the nature and implications of the reported vulnerabilities.

- Research and Analysis: I conducted in-depth research on the Apache Log4j vulnerability, known as Log4Shell (CVE-2021–44228), which is a critical remote code execution flaw.

- Communication: I drafted a clear advisory email to inform the relevant teams about the vulnerability and provided guidance on remediation steps.

This task underscored the importance of prompt and effective communication in cybersecurity. By alerting the infrastructure owner, John Doe, about the critical nature of the Log4j vulnerability, I helped ensure that immediate actions, such as upgrading Log4j to version 2.17.1 or later, were taken to mitigate potential risks.

### 2. Ransomware Bypass Techniques:
In this section, I was exposed to *ransomware attack simulations* and practiced defense techniques.
- *Understanding Bruteforcing*: I learned about bruteforcing as a method to recover encrypted data without succumbing to ransom demands.
- *Python Scripting*: I developed a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of an encrypted file, simulating a scenario where paying the ransom was not an option.

## Tools & Technologies Used:
- *Python*:  Utilized Python to write a script, specifically to bruteforce decryption keys to avoid paying ransom.
- *Threat Intelligence Platforms*: Engaged with various threat intelligence platforms to identify emerging zero-day exploits.

---

## Lessons Learnt:
- *Analytical Skills*: The program enhanced my ability to analyze cybersecurity threats and devise effective remediation strategies.
- *Technical Proficiency*: Utilizing Python for ethical hacking tasks reinforced my programming skills and understanding of cybersecurity tools.
- *Communication*: Crafting advisory emails improved my ability to communicate complex technical information clearly and effectively to non-technical stakeholders.
- *Vulnerability Research and Remediation*: Researching reported vulnerabilities and drafting clear, concise emails to guide teams on remediation strategies.

## Conclusion:
This internship allowed me to use my theory on a real world job simulation. By focusing on incident response, threat analysis, and ransomware defense. By utilized Python skills I was able to write a script for ethical hacking, avoiding ransom payments by bruteforcing decryption keys. Through this experience, I developed skills that are essential for my growth as a cybersecurity professional.
